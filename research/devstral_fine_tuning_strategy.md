# Comprehensive Implementation Strategy for Fine-Tuning Devstral Small (24B) Using the Elixir AI Ecosystem

## Executive Overview

This comprehensive guide presents a detailed implementation strategy for fine-tuning Devstral Small, a 24B parameter coding model, using Elixir's AI ecosystem. The strategy addresses all critical components from model implementation to production deployment, leveraging Elixir's unique strengths in concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed computing.

*This document serves as a complete roadmap for adapting a large language model (LLM) specifically for Elixir code generation and understanding. Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model and further training it on specialized data to improve its performance on specific tasks. In this case, we're teaching Devstral Small - a 24 billion parameter model designed for coding tasks - to better understand and generate Elixir code by training it on Elixir-specific datasets and patterns.*

## 1. Custom Bumblebee Support Implementation

**Section Overview:** This section focuses on implementing the core neural network architecture required to run Devstral Small within Elixir's AI ecosystem. Think of this as building the "brain" of the AI model from scratch using Elixir's machine learning libraries. Bumblebee is Elixir's library for running transformer models (the type of AI architecture that powers ChatGPT and similar systems), and Axon is Elixir's deep learning framework. Since Devstral Small uses a specific architecture called Mistral, we need to manually implement its components because they're not yet built into the standard Elixir AI libraries. This involves creating the attention mechanisms (how the model focuses on different parts of input), the tokenizer (how text is converted into numbers the model can understand), and the weight loading system (how the pre-trained model parameters are loaded into memory). The complexity here comes from translating a model designed for Python frameworks into Elixir's functional programming paradigm while maintaining mathematical accuracy.

### Model Architecture in Axon

**Sub-section Overview:** This sub-section implements the core mathematical operations that make up the Devstral model's "thinking" process. In transformer models like Devstral, the most critical component is the attention mechanism - imagine it as the model's ability to focus on different parts of the input text when generating each new word. Multi-head attention allows the model to pay attention to multiple aspects simultaneously (like syntax, semantics, and context), while grouped query attention is a memory optimization that reduces computational requirements without sacrificing performance. RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) helps the model understand the position of words in a sequence, which is crucial for maintaining coherent code structure. The sliding window attention allows the model to process very long code files efficiently by focusing on nearby context rather than the entire file. All of these components must be implemented from scratch in Axon because Devstral's specific architecture isn't yet available in Elixir's ML libraries.

Devstral Small is based on Mistral architecture, requiring custom implementation of key components:

```elixir
defmodule Bumblebee.Text.Devstral do
  import Nx.Defn
  
  def multi_head_attention(hidden_states, config) do
    %{
      hidden_size: hidden_size,
      num_attention_heads: num_heads,
      num_key_value_heads: num_kv_heads,
      head_dim: head_dim
    } = config

    # Multi-head attention with grouped query attention support
    query = Axon.dense(hidden_states, num_heads * head_dim, name: "query")
    key = Axon.dense(hidden_states, num_kv_heads * head_dim, name: "key") 
    value = Axon.dense(hidden_states, num_kv_heads * head_dim, name: "value")

    # Apply RoPE positional embeddings
    {query, key} = apply_rope(query, key, config)

    # Compute attention with sliding window
    attention_output = scaled_dot_product_attention(
      query, key, value, 
      config.attention_dropout,
      causal: true,
      sliding_window: config.sliding_window
    )

    Axon.dense(attention_output, hidden_size, name: "output")
  end
end
```

**Key Architecture Features:**
- **32 transformer layers** with 4096 hidden dimensions
- **Grouped Query Attention** (32 attention heads, 8 KV heads)
- **RoPE embeddings** with base 1,000,000 for 128k context
- **SwiGLU activation** for feed-forward networks
- **RMSNorm** instead of LayerNorm

### Tokenizer Integration

**Sub-section Overview:** The tokenizer is the bridge between human-readable text and the numerical representations that neural networks can process. Think of it as a sophisticated dictionary that converts words, symbols, and code elements into unique numbers. Devstral uses the Tekken tokenizer, which is specifically designed to handle code efficiently by recognizing programming constructs as single tokens rather than breaking them into individual characters. The large vocabulary size (131,072 tokens) allows it to represent complex programming patterns, function names, and even entire code snippets as single units, making the model more efficient at understanding and generating code. Special tokens like `<|code|>` and `<|function|>` help the model understand different types of content it's processing. Integrating this tokenizer into Elixir requires creating wrapper functions that can load the tokenizer configuration and handle the conversion between Elixir strings and the numerical token sequences the model expects.

Devstral uses the Tekken tokenizer with 131,072 vocabulary size:

```elixir
defmodule Bumblebee.Text.DevstralTokenizer do
  def load_tokenizer(repo_or_path, opts \\ []) do
    tokenizer_path = resolve_tokenizer_path(repo_or_path, "tekken.json")
    
    case Tokenizers.Tokenizer.from_file(tokenizer_path) do
      {:ok, tokenizer} ->
        special_tokens = %{
          bos: "<s>",
          eos: "</s>", 
          unk: "<unk>",
          pad: "</s>",
          code_start: "<|code|>",
          code_end: "<|/code|>",
          function_start: "<|function|>",
          function_end: "<|/function|>"
        }
        
        {:ok, %__MODULE__{
          tokenizer: tokenizer,
          special_tokens: special_tokens,
          vocab_size: 131072
        }}
    end
  end
end
```

### Weight Loading Strategy

**Sub-section Overview:** Model weights are the learned parameters that encode all of the model's knowledge - think of them as the "memories" the model has acquired during its initial training. For a 24 billion parameter model, these weights represent tens of gigabytes of data that must be carefully loaded into memory. The safetensors format is a secure and efficient way to store these weights, preventing malicious code execution while enabling fast loading. Memory-efficient loading is crucial because we need to fit everything into limited GPU memory. The quantization options (int4, int8) allow us to compress the weights by representing them with fewer bits - similar to how JPEG compression reduces image file sizes. This sub-section creates the infrastructure to load these pre-trained weights into our Elixir-based model, with support for different compression levels depending on available hardware resources.

Memory-efficient loading for 24B parameters:

```elixir
defmodule Bumblebee.HuggingFace.DevstralLoader do
  def load_params(repo, opts \\ []) do
    # Prefer safetensors format
    with {:ok, params_path} <- resolve_params_file(repo, "model.safetensors"),
         {:ok, raw_params} <- Safetensors.load_file(params_path) do
      
      converted_params = convert_parameter_names(raw_params)
      final_params = handle_quantization(converted_params, opts)
      
      {:ok, final_params}
    end
  end
  
  defp handle_quantization(params, opts) do
    case Keyword.get(opts, :quantization) do
      :int4 -> apply_int4_quantization(params)
      :int8 -> apply_int8_quantization(params)
      _ -> params
    end
  end
end
```

## 2. Data Collection Pipeline

**Section Overview:** This section outlines how to automatically gather and prepare the training data needed to teach the model about Elixir programming. Think of this as creating a comprehensive textbook for the AI by collecting real-world Elixir code from various sources. The pipeline scrapes code from Hex.pm (Elixir's package repository, similar to npm for JavaScript), GitHub repositories, and other sources to build a massive dataset of high-quality Elixir code examples. The collected code is then processed and converted into instruction-response pairs - essentially question-and-answer formats that help the model learn patterns like "when given this type of programming problem, generate this type of solution." This process involves parsing the code to understand its structure, extracting documentation and comments to create natural language descriptions, and organizing everything into a format suitable for machine learning training. The use of Elixir's Flow library allows this data processing to happen concurrently across multiple CPU cores, making the pipeline efficient even when processing thousands of code repositories.

### Automated Hex.pm Scraping

**Sub-section Overview:** Hex.pm is Elixir's official package repository, containing thousands of open-source Elixir libraries and applications. This sub-section creates an automated system to download and extract source code from these packages, providing a rich dataset of real-world, production-quality Elixir code. The scraper uses GenServer (an OTP behavior for stateful processes) to manage the downloading process reliably, handling network failures and rate limiting gracefully. By parsing the downloaded code into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), we can understand the structure and meaning of the code beyond just text, enabling us to extract patterns like function definitions, module relationships, and documentation. This creates a comprehensive dataset that represents the breadth of the Elixir ecosystem, from web applications to embedded systems, giving the model exposure to diverse coding patterns and best practices.

```elixir
defmodule HexScraper do
  use GenServer
  
  @hex_api_base "https://hex.pm/api"
  @repo_base "https://repo.hex.pm"

  def fetch_all_packages do
    fetch_packages_recursive(1, [])
  end

  def download_package(package_name, version) do
    url = "#{@repo_base}/tarballs/#{package_name}-#{version}.tar"
    
    case Req.get(url) do
      {:ok, %{status: 200, body: tarball}} ->
        extract_package_contents(tarball, package_name, version)
      {:error, reason} ->
        {:error, reason}
    end
  end

  defp parse_source_file(file_path) do
    content = File.read!(file_path)
    
    case Code.string_to_quoted(content, file: file_path) do
      {:ok, ast} ->
        %{
          file: file_path,
          content: content,
          ast: ast,
          functions: extract_functions_from_ast(ast),
          modules: extract_modules_from_ast(ast)
        }
    end
  end
end
```

### GitHub Integration with GraphQL

**Sub-section Overview:** GitHub hosts millions of Elixir repositories, many of which contain high-quality, well-maintained code that would be valuable for training. This sub-section implements a GraphQL-based scraper that can efficiently search for and retrieve Elixir repositories based on quality metrics like star count, recent activity, and licensing. GraphQL allows us to request exactly the data we need in a single API call, making the scraping process more efficient than traditional REST APIs. By filtering for repositories with minimum star counts and recent updates, we ensure we're collecting code that represents current best practices and is actively maintained. The licensing information helps ensure we only use code that's appropriate for training purposes, respecting open-source licensing requirements and avoiding proprietary code that shouldn't be included in training datasets.

```elixir
defmodule GitHubScraper do
  @github_api "https://api.github.com/graphql"

  def search_elixir_repositories(opts \\ []) do
    min_stars = Keyword.get(opts, :min_stars, 100)
    updated_after = Keyword.get(opts, :updated_after, "2022-01-01")
    
    query = """
    query($query: String!, $first: Int!, $after: String) {
      search(query: $query, type: REPOSITORY, first: $first, after: $after) {
        nodes {
          ... on Repository {
            name
            owner { login }
            stargazerCount
            primaryLanguage { name }
            licenseInfo { spdxId }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    """

    search_query = "language:elixir stars:>#{min_stars} pushed:>#{updated_after}"
    
    Neuron.query(query, %{
      query: search_query,
      first: 100
    })
  end
end
```

### Instruction Dataset Generation

**Sub-section Overview:** Raw code alone isn't enough to train a helpful coding assistant - the model needs to learn the relationship between problems and solutions. This sub-section transforms the collected code into instruction-following datasets, creating pairs of natural language descriptions and corresponding code implementations. For example, it might pair a function's documentation with its implementation, or create a description of what an OTP GenServer does and pair it with the actual GenServer code. This teaches the model to understand when a human asks "create a GenServer that handles user sessions," it should generate appropriate GenServer boilerplate with session management logic. The instruction generation process identifies different types of code patterns (like OTP behaviors, data transformation pipelines, web controllers) and creates diverse training examples that help the model learn to respond appropriately to various programming requests.

```elixir
defmodule InstructionDatasetGenerator do
  def generate_docstring_pairs(parsed_files) do
    parsed_files
    |> Enum.flat_map(&extract_documented_functions/1)
    |> Enum.map(&create_docstring_instruction/1)
  end

  def generate_otp_examples(modules) do
    modules
    |> Enum.filter(&is_otp_module?/1)
    |> Enum.map(&create_otp_instruction/1)
  end

  defp create_otp_instruction(module) do
    behavior = detect_otp_behavior(module[:content])
    
    %{
      instruction: "Create an Elixir #{behavior} module that implements the following functionality:",
      input: extract_module_purpose(module),
      output: module[:content]
    }
  end
end
```

### Flow-Based Processing Pipeline

**Sub-section Overview:** Processing thousands of repositories and millions of lines of code requires a robust, concurrent processing system. Flow is Elixir's library for building data processing pipelines that can efficiently utilize multiple CPU cores. This sub-section creates a pipeline that can download, parse, analyze, and transform code repositories in parallel, dramatically reducing processing time compared to sequential processing. The pipeline is designed with stages that can run independently - while one stage is downloading repositories, another can be parsing previously downloaded code, and a third can be generating instruction datasets from already-parsed code. Flow's backpressure mechanism ensures that fast stages don't overwhelm slower ones, and the partitioning allows the work to be distributed across available CPU cores. This approach leverages Elixir's strength in concurrent processing to make data preparation scalable and efficient.

```elixir
defmodule FlowDataPipeline do
  def process_repositories(repos, opts \\ []) do
    repos
    |> Flow.from_enumerable(max_demand: 50)
    |> Flow.partition(stages: 4)
    |> Flow.map(&fetch_repository_content/1)
    |> Flow.flat_map(&extract_source_files/1)
    |> Flow.map(&parse_and_analyze/1)
    |> Flow.filter(&meets_quality_threshold/1)
    |> Flow.map(&generate_instructions/1)
    |> Flow.run()
  end
end
```

## 3. QLoRA Implementation for 32GB VRAM

**Section Overview:** This section tackles one of the biggest challenges in fine-tuning large language models: memory requirements. A 24 billion parameter model normally requires hundreds of gigabytes of GPU memory, far beyond what most consumer or even professional hardware can provide. QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) is a breakthrough technique that makes it possible to fine-tune such large models on relatively modest hardware with just 32GB of VRAM. The approach works by using two key innovations: first, it reduces the precision of the model's numbers from 16-bit to 4-bit through quantization (imagine compressing a high-resolution image to save space), and second, it uses LoRA adapters which train only small additional layers instead of modifying the entire model. Think of LoRA like adding small specialized modules to an existing engine rather than rebuilding the entire engine. This section provides the mathematical implementations and memory management strategies needed to make this advanced technique work in Elixir, including gradient checkpointing (a memory-saving technique that recomputes certain calculations instead of storing them) and careful orchestration of when different parts of the model are loaded into memory.

### Memory Optimization Strategy

**Sub-section Overview:** This sub-section addresses the fundamental challenge of fitting a massive 24 billion parameter model into the memory constraints of consumer-grade hardware. Traditional fine-tuning would require hundreds of gigabytes of GPU memory, but through careful optimization techniques, we can reduce this to fit in 32GB VRAM. The strategy combines several techniques: 4-bit NF4 quantization compresses the model weights to 1/4 their original size, LoRA adapters train only small additional layers rather than the entire model, gradient checkpointing trades computation for memory by recomputing activations instead of storing them, and careful batch sizing ensures we never exceed memory limits. The detailed memory breakdown shows exactly how each component contributes to the total memory usage, providing a roadmap for optimization and helping developers understand what hardware requirements are realistic for their setup.

**Memory Requirements for 24B Model:**
- Base model (4-bit NF4): ~10.8GB
- LoRA adapters (r=8): ~100MB
- Optimizer states: ~400MB  
- Activations/gradients: 8-12GB
- **Total: 22-25GB** (fits in 32GB VRAM)

```elixir
defmodule QLoRA24B do
  def setup_training() do
    # Configure quantization
    quantization_config = %{
      bits: 4,
      type: :nf4,
      block_size: 64,
      double_quantization: true
    }
    
    # Apply quantization to base model
    quantized_model = apply_quantization(base_model, quantization_config)
    
    # Inject LoRA adapters
    lora_model = 
      quantized_model
      |> Axon.freeze()
      |> Lorax.inject(%Lorax.Config{
        r: 8,
        alpha: 16,
        dropout: 0.05,
        target_modules: ["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj"]
      })
    
    # Setup training with memory optimizations
    training_config = %{
      batch_size: 1,
      sequence_length: 2048,
      gradient_accumulation: 8,
      learning_rate: 2.0e-4,
      gradient_checkpointing: true
    }
  end
end
```

### NF4 Quantization Implementation

**Sub-section Overview:** NF4 (4-bit NormalFloat) quantization is a sophisticated compression technique that reduces model memory usage by representing weights with only 4 bits instead of the typical 16 bits, achieving a 75% reduction in memory usage. Unlike simple linear quantization that just divides a range into equal parts, NF4 uses a specially designed set of values that are optimized for the distribution of weights typically found in neural networks. The technique works by dividing the model weights into small blocks and finding the optimal scale factor for each block, then mapping each weight to the closest NF4 value. This preserves model accuracy much better than naive quantization approaches. The implementation includes "double quantization" which even quantizes the scale factors themselves, providing additional memory savings. This advanced technique makes it possible to run very large models on modest hardware while maintaining most of their original performance.

```elixir
defmodule NF4Quantization do
  @nf4_values [
    -1.0, -0.6961928009986877, -0.5250730514526367, -0.39491748809814453,
    -0.28444138169288635, -0.18477343022823334, -0.09105003625154495, 0.0,
    0.07958029955625534, 0.16093020141124725, 0.24611230194568634,
    0.33791524171829224, 0.44070982933044434, 0.5626170039176941,
    0.7229568362236023, 1.0
  ]
  
  def quantize_nf4(tensor, block_size \\ 64) do
    tensor
    |> Nx.reshape({:auto, block_size})
    |> Nx.map(fn block ->
      absmax = Nx.reduce_max(Nx.abs(block))
      scale = absmax / 1.0
      
      normalized = Nx.divide(block, scale)
      quantized = map_to_nf4_levels(normalized)
      
      {quantized, scale}
    end)
  end
end
```

### Gradient Checkpointing

**Sub-section Overview:** During neural network training, the model must store intermediate activations (computational results from each layer) to compute gradients during backpropagation. For large models, these activations can consume enormous amounts of memory. Gradient checkpointing is a memory-saving technique that selectively stores only some activations and recomputes the others when needed during backpropagation. It's a classic time-memory tradeoff: we use more computation time to save memory space. This sub-section implements checkpointing by marking certain layers in the model to save their activations while others are recomputed on-demand. The checkpointing frequency (every 2 layers in this example) can be tuned based on available memory and acceptable computational overhead. This technique is essential for training large models on memory-constrained hardware, often reducing memory usage by 50% or more with only a modest increase in training time.

```elixir
defmodule AxonGradientCheckpointing do
  def add_checkpoints(model, checkpoint_every \\ 2) do
    model
    |> Axon.map_nodes(fn node, layer_index ->
      if rem(layer_index, checkpoint_every) == 0 do
        %{node | opts: Keyword.put(node.opts, :checkpoint, true)}
      else
        node
      end
    end)
  end
end
```

## 4. Training Pipeline Implementation

**Section Overview:** This section describes the actual process of teaching the model to understand and generate Elixir code better. The training pipeline is designed as a two-stage process to maximize learning efficiency and prevent the model from "forgetting" its existing capabilities while gaining new ones. Stage 1 focuses on general Elixir and Erlang knowledge, exposing the model to a broad range of functional programming concepts, OTP (Open Telecom Platform) patterns, and BEAM ecosystem conventions. Stage 2 then fine-tunes the model on specific tasks like code completion, documentation generation, and problem-solving. The implementation leverages Elixir's OTP framework to create a fault-tolerant, distributed training system that can automatically recover from failures and coordinate across multiple GPUs or machines. Key innovations include Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to prevent catastrophic forgetting (where learning new information erases old knowledge), discriminative learning rates (different parts of the model learn at different speeds), and sophisticated checkpointing systems that ensure training progress is never lost due to hardware failures or interruptions.

### Two-Stage Fine-Tuning

**Sub-section Overview:** Fine-tuning large language models requires a careful, staged approach to prevent the model from losing its existing capabilities while learning new ones. This two-stage strategy first exposes the model to broad Elixir and Erlang knowledge (Stage 1) before focusing on specific tasks (Stage 2). Stage 1 uses a higher learning rate and focuses on general language understanding, OTP patterns, and functional programming concepts, helping the model adapt to Elixir's unique syntax and idioms. Stage 2 then fine-tunes on specific tasks like code completion, documentation generation, and problem-solving with a lower learning rate to avoid disrupting the knowledge gained in Stage 1. The learning rate scheduling uses warmup (gradually increasing the learning rate) followed by cosine annealing (gradually decreasing it) to optimize training stability and convergence. This approach maximizes learning while minimizing the risk of catastrophic forgetting, where new learning erases important previously learned information.

**Stage 1: General Elixir/Erlang Pre-training**
```elixir
defmodule DevstralFineTuning.Stage1 do
  @general_lr 2.0e-5
  @stage1_epochs 3

  def handle_call(:start_training, _from, state) do
    # Cosine annealing with warmup
    schedule = create_warmup_cosine_schedule(@general_lr, @stage1_epochs, warmup_ratio: 0.1)
    
    train_loop = 
      state.model
      |> Axon.Loop.trainer(:categorical_cross_entropy, state.optimizer)
      |> Axon.Loop.metric(:accuracy)
      |> attach_lr_scheduler(schedule)
      |> Axon.Loop.checkpoint(event: :epoch_completed)
    
    model_state = Axon.Loop.run(train_loop, state.dataset, epochs: @stage1_epochs)
    
    {:reply, {:ok, model_state}, %{state | epoch: @stage1_epochs}}
  end
end
```

**Stage 2: Task-Specific Fine-tuning**
```elixir
defmodule DevstralFineTuning.Stage2 do
  @task_specific_lr 5.0e-6

  def create_discriminative_optimizer(params) do
    # Different learning rates for different layers
    optimizers = %{
      embeddings: Polaris.Optimizers.adamw(learning_rate: @task_specific_lr * 0.1),
      early_layers: Polaris.Optimizers.adamw(learning_rate: @task_specific_lr * 0.5),
      late_layers: Polaris.Optimizers.adamw(learning_rate: @task_specific_lr),
      output_head: Polaris.Optimizers.adamw(learning_rate: @task_specific_lr * 2.0)
    }
    
    create_grouped_optimizer(layer_groups, optimizers)
  end
end
```

### Elastic Weight Consolidation

**Sub-section Overview:** Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) is an advanced technique to prevent catastrophic forgetting - the tendency of neural networks to completely forget previously learned tasks when learning new ones. EWC works by identifying which model parameters are most important for previously learned tasks and then constraining how much these parameters can change during new training. It does this by computing the Fisher Information Matrix, which measures how sensitive the model's predictions are to changes in each parameter. Parameters with high Fisher information are considered "important" and are penalized more heavily if they change during new training. This creates an "elastic" constraint that allows the model to learn new tasks while preserving critical knowledge from previous training. In the context of fine-tuning Devstral for Elixir, EWC helps ensure the model retains its general coding abilities while specializing in Elixir-specific patterns. The technique is mathematically sophisticated but essential for successful continual learning in large language models.

```elixir
defmodule DevstralFineTuning.EWC do
  def compute_fisher_information(model, dataset) do
    dataset
    |> Enum.reduce({fisher_accumulator, 0}, fn batch, {acc, count} ->
      {predictions, _} = Axon.predict(model, model.params, batch.input)
      
      {gradients, _} = Nx.Defn.grad(fn params ->
        {preds, _} = Axon.predict(model, params, batch.input)
        log_likelihood(preds, sampled_labels)
      end).(model.params)
      
      updated_acc = accumulate_fisher_gradients(acc, gradients)
      {updated_acc, count + 1}
    end)
    |> finalize_fisher_information(batch_count)
  end

  def ewc_loss(%__MODULE__{} = ewc, current_params, base_loss) do
    ewc_penalty = compute_ewc_penalty(ewc, current_params)
    Nx.add(base_loss, Nx.multiply(ewc.ewc_lambda, ewc_penalty))
  end
end
```

### Distributed Training with OTP

**Sub-section Overview:** Training large models can take days or weeks on a single machine, but distributed training across multiple GPUs or machines can dramatically reduce this time. This sub-section leverages Elixir's OTP (Open Telecom Platform) framework to create a fault-tolerant distributed training system. OTP provides battle-tested patterns for building distributed, concurrent systems that can handle failures gracefully. In this implementation, multiple worker processes train on different portions of the data simultaneously, then periodically synchronize their gradients (the learning updates) through an "all-reduce" operation that averages the gradients across all workers. The coordinator process manages this synchronization and handles worker failures by redistributing work to healthy nodes. This approach takes advantage of Elixir's "let it crash" philosophy and supervisor trees to create a training system that can automatically recover from hardware failures, network partitions, or other issues that would normally require manual intervention to restart training from checkpoints.

```elixir
defmodule DevstralFineTuning.DistributedTrainer do
  def coordinate_training(worker_pids, state) do
    Enum.reduce_while(1..max_steps, state, fn step, acc_state ->
      worker_gradients = collect_worker_gradients(worker_pids, step)
      
      if rem(step, sync_frequency) == 0 do
        synchronized_gradients = all_reduce_gradients(worker_gradients)
        updated_state = apply_synchronized_gradients(acc_state, synchronized_gradients)
        broadcast_updated_parameters(worker_pids, updated_state.model_state)
        
        {:cont, %{updated_state | global_step: step}}
      end
    end)
  end
end
```

### Fault-Tolerant Checkpointing

**Sub-section Overview:** Training large language models is computationally expensive and time-consuming, making it crucial to save progress regularly in case of hardware failures, power outages, or other interruptions. This sub-section implements a comprehensive checkpointing system that captures not just the model weights, but all the information needed to resume training exactly where it left off. This includes the optimizer state (which tracks momentum and other training dynamics), the current position in the dataset, random number generator states (to ensure reproducible training), and metadata about the training environment. The checkpoints are serialized using Erlang's built-in binary format with compression to minimize storage space and I/O time. The system can automatically detect interrupted training sessions and resume from the most recent checkpoint, making the training process resilient to infrastructure issues. This fault tolerance is especially important for multi-day training runs where even small interruptions would otherwise result in significant lost progress and computational costs.

```elixir
defmodule DevstralFineTuning.CheckpointManager do
  def create_checkpoint(training_state, state) do
    checkpoint_data = %{
      model_state: training_state.model_state,
      optimizer_state: training_state.optimizer_state,
      global_step: training_state.global_step,
      epoch: training_state.epoch,
      rng_state: Nx.Random.key(42),
      metadata: %{
        timestamp: DateTime.utc_now(),
        elixir_version: System.version()
      }
    }
    
    serialized_data = :erlang.term_to_binary(checkpoint_data, [:compressed])
    File.write!(checkpoint_path, serialized_data)
  end
end
```

## 5. Elixir-Specific Optimizations

**Section Overview:** This section focuses on teaching the model to understand the unique aspects of Elixir programming that differentiate it from other languages. While the base Devstral model understands general programming concepts, Elixir has distinctive features that require specialized attention during training. This includes handling Elixir's unique syntax elements like atoms (immutable constants that start with colons), the pipe operator (|>) that enables elegant data transformation chains, pattern matching that allows destructuring data in function definitions, and module attributes that store compile-time data. The section also covers OTP (Open Telecom Platform) pattern recognition, teaching the model to understand and generate common supervision tree structures, GenServer implementations, and process-based concurrency patterns that are fundamental to Elixir applications. Additionally, it addresses BEAM-specific concepts like the "let it crash" philosophy, hot code reloading, and the immutable data structures that make Elixir particularly suited for distributed, fault-tolerant systems. These optimizations ensure the fine-tuned model doesn't just generate syntactically correct Elixir code, but code that follows idiomatic patterns and leverages the platform's unique strengths.

### Custom Tokenization for Elixir Syntax

**Sub-section Overview:** While the base Devstral model's tokenizer handles general programming languages well, Elixir has unique syntactic elements that benefit from specialized tokenization strategies. This sub-section ensures the model properly understands Elixir's distinctive features rather than treating them as arbitrary character sequences. Atoms (like `:ok` or `:error`) are fundamental to Elixir's pattern matching and should be tokenized as single units. The pipe operator (`|>`) is central to Elixir's data transformation style and needs special handling to maintain its semantic meaning. Pattern matching operators (`=` for matching, `<-` for comprehensions) are syntactically crucial and should be preserved as meaningful tokens. Module attributes (prefixed with `@`) store compile-time data and have specific scoping rules. Unicode support is essential because Elixir fully supports Unicode identifiers, allowing developers to use international characters in function and variable names. Proper tokenization of these elements helps the model generate more idiomatic Elixir code that follows community conventions and leverages the language's unique strengths.

Key considerations for Elixir-aware tokenization:
- **Atoms**: Special handling for `:atom` syntax
- **Pipe operator**: Preserve `|>` semantic meaning
- **Pattern matching**: Maintain structure of `=` and `<-`
- **Module attributes**: Handle `@` prefixed attributes
- **Unicode support**: Full Unicode identifier support

### OTP Pattern Recognition

**Sub-section Overview:** OTP (Open Telecom Platform) is the foundation of robust Elixir applications, providing battle-tested patterns for building concurrent, fault-tolerant systems. This sub-section trains the model to recognize and generate proper OTP implementations, which are essential for production Elixir applications. GenServers are stateful processes that handle synchronous and asynchronous messages through specific callback functions (`handle_call`, `handle_cast`, `handle_info`), and the model needs to understand when to use each type. Supervisor trees define how processes should be started, monitored, and restarted when they crash, implementing the "let it crash" philosophy that makes Elixir systems so resilient. Message passing patterns show how processes communicate with each other safely without sharing state. Process monitoring (links and monitors) ensures that process failures are detected and handled appropriately. Understanding these patterns is crucial because they represent decades of experience in building distributed, fault-tolerant systems, and they're what makes Elixir particularly suited for mission-critical applications like telecommunications, finance, and real-time systems.

Training the model to understand:
- **GenServer patterns**: `handle_call`, `handle_cast`, `handle_info`
- **Supervisor trees**: Child specifications and restart strategies
- **Message passing**: Send/receive patterns
- **Process monitoring**: Links and monitors

### BEAM-Specific Tuning

**Sub-section Overview:** The BEAM virtual machine (which runs Elixir and Erlang) has unique characteristics that differentiate it from other runtime environments, and the model needs to understand these to generate truly effective Elixir code. Process-based concurrency means that instead of sharing memory between threads (like most languages), BEAM creates lightweight, isolated processes that communicate through message passing - this fundamental difference affects how concurrent programs should be structured. Immutability patterns reflect that data structures in Elixir cannot be modified in place, leading to different algorithmic approaches and performance considerations compared to mutable languages. The "let it crash" philosophy encourages designing systems where processes can fail safely and be restarted by supervisors, rather than trying to prevent all possible errors - this requires a different approach to error handling than defensive programming in other languages. Hot code reloading allows running systems to be updated without stopping, which influences how modules should be structured and versioned. Understanding these BEAM-specific concepts is essential for generating Elixir code that doesn't just work, but leverages the platform's unique strengths for building scalable, fault-tolerant systems.

Optimizations for BEAM VM:
- **Process-based concurrency**: Understanding isolated processes
- **Immutability patterns**: Functional programming paradigms
- **Let it crash philosophy**: Error handling patterns
- **Hot code reloading**: Module update patterns

## 6. Production Deployment Strategy

**Section Overview:** This section transitions from training the model to actually using it in real-world applications. Production deployment involves creating a robust, scalable system that can serve the fine-tuned model to end users through web applications, APIs, or development tools. The strategy leverages Phoenix (Elixir's web framework) to create real-time interfaces using WebSockets and channels, allowing for streaming responses where users can see the model generating code in real-time. The distributed inference system uses GenServers to manage multiple model instances across different machines or GPUs, implementing load balancing and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability. Model versioning and blue-green deployment strategies allow for seamless updates without service interruption - you can deploy a new version of the model alongside the old one and gradually shift traffic over once you're confident in its performance. The monitoring and telemetry systems track inference latency, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization, providing the observability needed to maintain a production ML service. This architecture takes advantage of Elixir's inherent strengths in building distributed, concurrent systems that can handle thousands of simultaneous requests while maintaining fault tolerance and real-time responsiveness.

### Phoenix Integration Architecture

**Sub-section Overview:** Phoenix is Elixir's web framework, built on top of OTP principles to handle massive numbers of concurrent connections efficiently. This sub-section creates a real-time interface for the fine-tuned model using Phoenix Channels, which provide WebSocket-based communication for streaming responses. Unlike traditional request-response APIs where users wait for complete responses, this implementation allows users to see the model generating code in real-time, token by token, creating a more interactive and responsive experience. The Channel handles incoming generation requests by spawning asynchronous tasks that stream results back to the client as they're produced. This approach leverages Elixir's lightweight process model to handle thousands of simultaneous code generation requests without blocking. The streaming architecture is particularly valuable for code generation because it allows users to see progress on longer responses and provides immediate feedback, improving the overall user experience while showcasing Elixir's strengths in real-time, concurrent applications.

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.InferenceChannel do
  use Phoenix.Channel
  
  def handle_in("generate", %{"prompt" => prompt} = params, socket) do
    task = Task.async(fn ->
      ModelInference.stream_completion(prompt, params)
    end)
    
    spawn_link(fn ->
      stream_responses(task, socket)
    end)
    
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
  
  defp stream_responses(task, socket) do
    case Task.yield(task, 100) || Task.shutdown(task) do
      {:ok, {:ok, stream}} ->
        Enum.each(stream, fn chunk ->
          push(socket, "chunk", %{data: chunk})
        end)
        push(socket, "complete", %{})
    end
  end
end
```

### Distributed Inference with GenServers

**Sub-section Overview:** Serving a large language model in production requires distributing inference across multiple machines or GPUs to handle high request volumes and provide redundancy. This sub-section uses GenServers (OTP's stateful process behavior) to create model shards - individual processes that each handle a portion of the model or serve independent copies for load distribution. Each ModelShard GenServer manages its own model state and handles inference requests asynchronously, allowing the system to process multiple requests concurrently without blocking. The GenServer pattern provides built-in error handling and state management, making it easy to track active requests, handle timeouts, and recover from failures. This architecture can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster and vertically by running multiple shards per machine. The OTP supervision tree ensures that failed shards are automatically restarted, maintaining system availability even when individual components fail. This approach combines Elixir's concurrency strengths with proven distributed systems patterns to create a robust, scalable inference platform.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ModelInference.ModelShard do
  use GenServer
  
  def handle_call({:inference, request_id, input}, from, state) do
    task = Task.async(fn ->
      perform_inference(state.model_state, input)
    end)
    
    new_state = put_in(state.active_requests[request_id], {from, task})
    {:noreply, new_state}
  end
end
```

### Model Versioning and Blue-Green Deployment

**Sub-section Overview:** Production machine learning systems need to support seamless model updates without service interruption, as new versions of fine-tuned models are deployed to improve performance or fix issues. Blue-green deployment is a proven strategy where two identical environments (blue and green) are maintained, with one serving production traffic while the other remains idle or serves a small percentage of traffic for testing. This sub-section implements a version management system that can gradually shift traffic between model versions, allowing for safe rollouts and immediate rollbacks if issues are detected. The traffic splitting capability enables A/B testing, where different users receive responses from different model versions to compare performance metrics. Load balancer weight updates allow fine-grained control over traffic distribution, making it possible to slowly ramp up a new model version from 1% to 100% of traffic while monitoring performance metrics. This approach minimizes the risk of deploying faulty models while enabling continuous improvement and experimentation with different model configurations.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ModelInference.VersionManager do
  def switch_traffic(from_version, to_version, percentage \\ 100) do
    new_routing = %{
      from_version => 100 - percentage,
      to_version => percentage
    }
    
    update_load_balancer_weights(new_routing)
  end
end
```

### Performance Monitoring

**Sub-section Overview:** Production machine learning systems require comprehensive monitoring to ensure they meet performance requirements and to detect issues before they impact users. This sub-section implements telemetry collection using Elixir's built-in `:telemetry` system, which provides a standardized way to emit and collect metrics throughout the application. The monitoring captures key performance indicators like inference latency (how long it takes to generate responses), throughput (how many requests are handled per second), error rates, and resource utilization. Telemetry spans measure the duration of inference requests from start to finish, providing detailed timing information that can help identify performance bottlenecks. The event handling system can trigger alerts when performance degrades, such as when latency exceeds acceptable thresholds. This observability is crucial for maintaining service level agreements (SLAs) and for optimizing system performance over time. The metrics can be integrated with monitoring systems like Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud monitoring services to provide dashboards and alerting capabilities that help operations teams maintain the health of the ML service.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ModelInference.Telemetry do
  def measure_inference(fun) do
    :telemetry.span([:model_inference, :request], %{}, fun)
  end
  
  def handle_event([:model_inference, :request, :stop], measurements, metadata, _config) do
    latency = measurements.duration
    
    :telemetry.execute([:my_app, :inference, :latency], %{duration: latency})
    
    if latency > 5_000_000_000 do # 5 seconds
      Logger.warning("High latency detected", duration: latency)
    end
  end
end
```
