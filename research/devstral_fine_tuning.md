# Fine-tuning multi-language coding LLMs for Elixir/Erlang specialization

Recent advances in code LLMs have created opportunities for language-specific specialization, but achieving optimal performance for functional programming languages like Elixir and Erlang requires careful orchestration of multiple techniques. This research synthesizes findings from 2023-2024 on strategies for restricting multi-language models to BEAM languages while preventing catastrophic forgetting and maintaining code quality.

## Two-stage fine-tuning prevents format overfitting

The most effective approach for language specialization employs a two-stage framework called **ProMoT (Prompt Tuning with Model Tuning)**. This method first performs prompt tuning to capture task-specific formatting, then fine-tunes the model with the soft prompt attached. Research shows this reduces format specialization by up to **40%** while maintaining **95%** of single-task performance and preserving **80%** of general capabilities.

For Elixir/Erlang specialization, **QLoRA emerges as the optimal parameter-efficient method**, requiring only 3% of total parameters to be updated. Key configuration includes rank values between 8-16, targeting all linear layers (q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, o_proj), with learning rates of 2e-4 using cosine scheduling. This approach enables training 33B models on single 24GB GPUs while preserving base model knowledge.

Catastrophic forgetting prevention relies on **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** combined with selective knowledge distillation. EWC adds a quadratic penalty term λ/2 * Σ F_i(θ_i - θ*_i)² to prevent significant changes to parameters crucial for previous tasks. Full Fisher Information Matrix computation shows **15-20%** better retention compared to diagonal approximations, with optimal λ values ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 based on task similarity.

## Hybrid tokenization optimizes functional constructs

Tokenizer specialization for BEAM languages requires a hybrid approach combining existing subword tokenizers with Elixir/Erlang-specific extensions. **Tree-sitter integration** provides structural understanding for accurate tokenization of complex constructs like pattern matching, pipe operators (|>), and atoms.

Critical tokenization improvements include treating the pipe operator as an atomic token rather than fragmenting it, preserving pattern matching structure across nested expressions, and creating dedicated token classes for atoms versus identifiers. The recommended vocabulary extension adds **500-1000 BEAM-specific tokens**, including the 200 most common atoms from Hex package analysis and functional operators like |>, <-, ->, and =>.

This specialized tokenization yields **20-30%** efficiency improvements for functional programming constructs while maintaining compatibility with existing LLM architectures. Guard clauses, list comprehensions, and GenServer patterns particularly benefit from semantic clustering in the tokenization process.

## DeepSeek-Coder models excel at aggressive specialization

Architecture analysis reveals **decoder-only models consistently outperform encoder-decoder alternatives** for code generation tasks. Among available options, **DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B** offers the best balance for most practitioners, with excellent project-level context understanding (16K tokens) and proven aggressive fine-tuning capabilities.

For maximum performance with adequate resources, **DeepSeek-Coder-33B** achieves state-of-the-art results with 81% HumanEval score. Memory requirements range from 14GB (FP16) or 4GB (4-bit quantized) for 7B models to 66GB or 20GB respectively for 33B variants. StarCoder2-15B provides a strong middle ground with enhanced math reasoning capabilities beneficial for functional programming paradigms.

The decoder-only architecture proves particularly suited to functional languages' compositional nature, excelling at pattern matching syntax and understanding immutable data structures inherent to Elixir/Erlang development.

## Synthetic generation expands limited training data

Data augmentation strategies address the scarcity of Elixir/Erlang training examples through multiple approaches. **LLM-driven synthetic generation** provides 3-5x dataset expansion with 85-90% semantic correctness, using techniques like multi-turn program synthesis and cross-language translation from Haskell or Clojure.

Template-based generation creates variations of common OTP behaviors, data transformation pipelines, and recursion patterns. Mutation-based augmentation systematically generates equivalent implementations through variable renaming, pattern matching variations, and control flow transformations.

The optimal training mixture starts with a **70:30 ratio of general programming to Elixir-specific code**, progressively shifting to 40:60 as the model adapts. Including 10-15% Erlang code ensures BEAM VM understanding, while 15-20% from related functional languages (Haskell, Clojure) provides transfer learning benefits. Research confirms that **1,000 high-quality examples outperform 10,000 low-quality ones**, with performance stabilizing after 100-500 carefully curated training examples.

## Native Elixir tools enable production deployment

Technical implementation leverages Elixir's native AI ecosystem, with **Bumblebee providing HuggingFace-compatible inference** and **Axon/Lorax enabling LoRA fine-tuning**. Bumblebee supports loading fine-tuned models with automatic batching through Nx.Serving, seamless Phoenix/LiveView integration, and GPU acceleration via EXLA backend.

LoRA implementation in Lorax significantly reduces GPU requirements, with recommended configurations of r=2, alpha=4 for models around 1B parameters. Memory optimization techniques include lazy transfers, gradient checkpointing, and mixed precision training. EXLA compilation provides **35x speedup** over CPU with **8x memory efficiency** improvements.

Practical deployment patterns demonstrate production readiness, including distributed inference across Elixir clusters, GPU-enabled Fly.io deployments, and fault-tolerant supervision trees maintaining model availability. Current limitations include model support restricted to Bumblebee implementations and training speed gaps compared to Python ecosystems.

## Multi-dimensional evaluation ensures quality

Evaluation frameworks must balance functional correctness with language adherence through composite scoring: 40% functional correctness, 30% language idiomaticity, 20% code quality, and 10% performance efficiency. **ElixirEval**, an adaptation of HumanEval, provides 164 problems requiring pattern matching, guards, and functional style with ExUnit test suites.

Domain-specific benchmarks test OTP design patterns, BEAM VM performance characteristics, and framework-specific capabilities for Phoenix and Nerves. Automated quality pipelines integrate Credo for style checking, Dialyxir for type analysis, and Sobelow for security scanning.

Language purity metrics track the proportion of Elixir-specific constructs used appropriately while penalizing anti-patterns like excessive imperative constructs. Pass@k evaluation adapted for Elixir includes property-based testing with StreamData, ensuring robust functional correctness across varying input conditions.

## Conclusion

Successful specialization of multi-language LLMs for Elixir/Erlang requires coordinated application of two-stage fine-tuning, hybrid tokenization strategies, and careful model selection. The combination of ProMoT training, QLoRA parameter efficiency, and EWC forgetting prevention enables **15-30% performance improvements** on language-specific tasks while maintaining general capabilities. Native Elixir tools provide production-ready deployment paths, though practitioners should expect initial setup complexity when adapting models without existing Bumblebee support. The key to success lies in high-quality, domain-specific training data combined with progressive specialization approaches that respect functional programming paradigms.
